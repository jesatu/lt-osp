This skill allows a character to strike for the Through effect with a small or medium melee weapon held in their primary hand, provided that the target is either unaware of the attack or unable to move. If the target is able to respond to the attack only the first blow will inflict Through damage. If the target is Immobilised any subsequent blows may also inflict Through damage. This cannot be used with a skill, lammie or loresheet that would modify the damage effect.
