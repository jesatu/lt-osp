This skill allows a character to check an area for tracks. The character will gain a rough idea as to the type of creatures in that area, their approximate numbers and roughly how long ago they were there (this can only be done in an area where it is possible to leave tracks). The character using Tracking must role-play checking the area for 30 seconds. This skill requires the presence of a marshal or referee. Weather and other conditions may make this skill unusable; the marshal or referee will inform if it is possible to use the skill at that time and in that area.
