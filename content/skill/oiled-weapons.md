A character with this skill may apply weapon oils to and use an oiled melee weapon without the Poison Lore CS. This cannot be used with a skill, lammie or loresheet that would modify the damage effect and it will not grant access to the Poison Loresheet. Requires concentration to use as per the Poison Lore CS and a Referee will also be required. If this skill is used with any poison other than a weapon oil it will affect the character when they attempt to apply it.
