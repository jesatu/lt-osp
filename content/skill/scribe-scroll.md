At each LT Main Event the character may produce two scrolls at each Moot, three at the Great Erdrejan Fayre or Gathering, for each level of casting they have in each pre requisite CS. The character must be in the relevant Guildâ€™s area to use this skill and purchase the materials needed. The player may create their own scroll phys- rep or obtain a standard scroll phys-rep from the relevant Guild. Standards to which the scroll phys-rep must conform can be obtained from either the Guilds or Game Control but the wording on the scroll must contain the vocals of the spell effect. E.g. Spellcasting 2 and Incantation 1 allow the production of two level 1 Incantation scrolls, two level 1 Spellcasting scrolls and two level 2 Spellcasting scrolls at the Moots( if they had High Magic Spellcasting, they would also be able to produce two level 3 Spellcasting scrolls). The intrinsic cost for the materials will vary from time to time and can be obtained from the relevant Guild. Note: Effects or abilities may not be written into scrolls using this OS.
