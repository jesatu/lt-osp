This skill replaces the Discern Pattern Type OS. The character may place a hand within 2 inches (~5 centimetres) of a target and concentrate for 10 seconds to discern their pattern type (Living, Unliving, or Magical), if they are an Alien or Aberrant pattern and if they are under the effects of a possession. They will not be able to detect the rank of the possession. If a referee or marshal is present they may add additional information.
