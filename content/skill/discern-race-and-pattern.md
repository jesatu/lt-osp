This skill replaces the Discern Race OS. After 10 seconds concentration on a single target within 30 feet (~9 meters), the character may make the call “discern race and pattern” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. The discern will give the race on the target's character card and if their pattern state is Living, Unliving or Magical.
