This skill replaces the [Identify OS][identify]. A character with this skill can identify the precise powers and abilities of a magical item after a period of careful study. This skill requires the presence of a referee (preferably with a radio), who will inform the player how long the study will take. The period of study will generally be as long it takes the referee to procure the information and may in some cases take until the next LT Main Event. When complete the player may see the powers card for the item, there may also be additional information at the refereeâ€™s discretion.
