This skill allows the character to use healing herbs. Characters with this skill can collect up to 5 ‘Herb Lore’ cards per event, dependant on the local environment, from the relevant Guild at LT Main Events. These cards will have the type of damage they can cure written on them. Herbs will duplicate the effects of Cure Wound, Remove Disease or Purge Poison. They take 10 seconds to use and this does not require concentration. At Sanctioned Events cards may be given by the event organisers or characters may be able to collect them IC. The cards represent herbs IC and can be stolen or traded.
