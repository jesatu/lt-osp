This skill replaces the Create Reagents (Improved) OS. The character may create two alchemical reagents at each LT Main Event and produce one additional potion or poison of a type they can already produce using ingredients that can be purchased and used in the relevant Guild. This cannot be used to create additional magical potions or poisons.
