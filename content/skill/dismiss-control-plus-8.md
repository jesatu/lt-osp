This skill will replace the Wedge Mastery (Improved) OS and allow the character to add up to 8 to the power of any dismiss or control they cast in addition to any spell cards they use, including casting as part of a wedge. Note: if the character is part of a wedge then they must contribute at least one spell card and there must be at least two characters in the wedge to be able to use this effect.
