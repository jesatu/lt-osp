A character with this skill can, after 10 seconds of concentration at a range of up to 30 feet (~9 meters), make the call “discern level of Daemonic being or possession” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. If the target examined is a Daemonic being or has a Daemonic possession they should tell the discerner the dismiss level. Some Daemonic creatures may be shielded from this effect, see [Shield Dismiss Level OS][shield-dismiss-level].
