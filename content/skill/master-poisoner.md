The character may place a venom poison or weapon oil upon an object or area not exceeding 1 foot by 1 foot (approx. 30 cm) in size. The first person to touch this object or area will be affected by the oil or venom in all ways as if struck by a weapon. This requires the presence of a referee or marshal and they will determine a reasonable amount of time that the poison will linger on the surface, not to exceed 30 mins, when the poison will be spoiled. Additionally the venom or weapon oil may be directly applied to an immobilised or unconscious character by concentrating for 10 seconds with the primary hand held 2" (~5 cm) from the target area.
