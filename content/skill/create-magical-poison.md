Pre-requisites to learn: [Create Poison 3]({{< relref "create-poison-3.md" >}}) & Poison Lore.

Requirements to use: Poison lore CS.

This skill replaces the Create Poison 3 OS and allows the character to make a level 1, a level 2 and a level 3 poison at each LT Main Event plus one magical poison an Event Season with ingredients that can be obtained and used in the relevant Guild. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities. Instead of making a new poison they may distil an existing poison to improve it by one level, subject to the normal restrictions on distilling.
