This skill replaces the [Revitalise Unliving OS][revitalise-unliving] and allows a character to extend a Chant of Repair Unliving to every location on a single character, for no additional spell cards. The repair is location by location, not simultaneous and the repairer may choose what damage to repair first. Contact with any part of the target is sufficient and the spell functions in all other ways as normal.
