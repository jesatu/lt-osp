This skill allows the character to make a level 1 potion at each LT Main Event with ingredients that can be obtained and used in the relevant Guild. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities. Instead of making a new potion they may distil an existing potion to improve it by one level, subject to the normal restrictions on distilling.
