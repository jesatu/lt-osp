This skill replaces the Through OS and allows a character to strike for the Through effect with thrown weapons thrown from their primary hand (requires thrown weapon CS), or with melee blows from small or medium melee weapon held in their primary hand. This cannot be used with a skill, lammie or loresheet that would modify the damage effect.
