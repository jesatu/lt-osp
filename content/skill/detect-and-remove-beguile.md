This skill gives a character the ability to detect and remove the Beguile effect. To detect if an individual is under the influence of a Beguile, the character must engage them in meaningful conversation for at least 30 seconds, after which they may make the call “detect beguile”. To remove a Beguile it must be detected as above, the character must then continue the conversation for at least a further minute. At the end of this period all effects of the Beguile are removed. This ability requires concentration.
