This skill replaces the [Mortician OS][mortician] and enables a character with the Physician CS to use it on corporeal Unliving characters. A character with Mortician (Expert) is also able to repair extreme damage done to a corporeal Unliving such as scars, broken bones and lost limbs. To repair extreme damage the Mortician (Expert) must inflict a mortal wound on the damaged location using a small weapon and spend a total of 1 minute of roleplay action. After this minute a referee or marshal will inform if the extreme damage has been repaired but the location will still be suffering from the mortal wound.
