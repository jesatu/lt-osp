This skill allows the character to make a level 1 melee weapon or shield at each LT Main Event with tools that can be obtained and used in the relevant Guild. The character must gain permission from the relevant Guild to use their facilities. Instead of making a new weapon/shield they may reforge an existing weapon or shield and improve it by one level, subject to the normal restrictions on reforging.
