A Channeller with this skill may add to any non-instant Cure (in the Cure Category) spell the vocal “I claim an aura of defence”. They will then be under an Aura of Defence while casting the non-instant Cure spell. The Aura of Defence effect will end as soon as the location(s) being cured are fully cured.
