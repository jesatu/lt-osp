A character with this skill can, after 10 seconds of concentration at a range of up to 30 feet (~9 meters), make the call “discern level of ancestral being or possession” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. If the target examined is an ancestral being or has an ancestral possession they should tell the discerner the dismiss level. Some Ancestral creatures may be shielded from this effect, see [Shield Dismiss Level OS][shield-dismiss-level].
