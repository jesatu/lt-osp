The character may use any magical enchantment spell that they would normally be able to cast, with a projectile weapon instead of a melee weapon. Any ammunition shot from the weapon will strike for the effect stated in the spell. Where the spell states the first successful blow this will be the first shot, even if this does not strike a target. Any damage effect generated will replace the normal Through effect of an arrow or bolt.
