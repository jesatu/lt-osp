This skill replaces the Revive OS and allows a character to extend a Chant of Heal Wound to affect every location on a single character, without requiring extra spell cards. The healing is location by location, not simultaneous and the healer may choose what damage to heal first. Contact with any part of the target is sufficient and the spell functions in all other ways as normal.
