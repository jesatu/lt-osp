A character with this skill can disarm traps. All traps require a referee or marshal who will describe the damage taken should the trap be set off. Disarming traps will require the player to physically disarm the trap without setting it off. Characters without the trap lore skill will automatically set off any trap they attempt to disarm. Setting and disguising a trap is a complicated and time consuming procedure and cannot normally be done at an event.
