This skill replaces the Bowyer (Apprentice) OS and allows the character to make a level 1 and a level 2 projectile weapon at each LT Main Event with tools that can be obtained and used in the relevant Guild area. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities. Instead of making a new weapon they may rework an existing weapon and improve it by one level, subject to the normal restrictions on reworking.
