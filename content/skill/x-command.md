They may teach a maximum of two skills in each Event Season and each skill may be up to and including Tier 4. Skills marked with an @ may only be taught if the pupil has fulfilled any IC pre-requisites needed to learn that skill. The character learning the skill must still possess any pre-requisites needed to learn the new skill (see Chapter One for more details on tutoring). The character is immune to all Lethal Alchemical Poisons.
