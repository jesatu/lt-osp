This skill replaces the Repair Unliving (Advanced) OS. After Chanting for 10 seconds whilst touching the target, a character with this OS can restore all locations on a single Unliving target to full body hits (LHV). It costs 2 spell cards to use this ability. Note: this ability is not a spell, and may not be combined with Spell Reduction
