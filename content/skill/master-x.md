This skill replaces the [Journeyman \<X> OS][journeyman-x] (where \<X> is the same). This skill allows the character to gain extra income and represents the characterâ€™s profession, \<X>. The player can collect an extra 8 Stell from Game Control once per Gathering if paid on the gate or, if pre-booked, it will be included in the return pack.
