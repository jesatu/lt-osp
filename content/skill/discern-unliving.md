A character with this skill may, after 10 seconds of concentration on a single target within 30 feet (~9 meters), make the call “discern level of Unliving being or possession” or ask a referee or marshal to enquire from the target. If the target examined is an Unliving being or has an Unliving possession they should tell the discerner the dismiss level. Some Unliving creatures may be shielded from this effect, see [Shield Dismiss Level OS][shield-dismiss-level].
