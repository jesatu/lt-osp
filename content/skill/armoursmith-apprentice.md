This skill allows the character to make a level 1 suit of armour at each LT Main Event with tools that can be obtained and used in the relevant Guild area. The character must gain permission from the Guild to use their facilities. Instead of making a new suit they may reforge an existing suit and improve it by one level, subject to the normal restrictions on reforging.
