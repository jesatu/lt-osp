This skill replaces the [Dismiss or Control +4 OS][dismiss-control-plus-4] and a character with this skill may add 8 to the power of any dismiss or control wedge that they are acting as the focus of, in addition to any spell cards they use. If they are not the focus they may still add up to 4 to the power of any dismiss or control they cast themselves or as part of a wedge, in addition to any spell cards they use. Note: if the character is part of a wedge then they must contribute at least one spell card and the wedge must be at least two characters to be able to use this effect.
