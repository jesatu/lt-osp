## OSP Updates in 2020

To whet your appetite we would like to pre-announce the long-awaited Casino Occupational Skills List. These Occupationa Skills are available in-game using the Casino Training Vouchers that can be earned or otherwise obtained ingame. For more details visit the Casino at any of the Main Events. The list will be published in the updated Occupational Skills Booklet available on the Lorien Trust Website over this Winter.

This update includes two new skills for Casino: [Conceal Item (Improved)][conceal-item-improved] and [Perform Teleport Rite][perform-teleport-rite].


[conceal-item-improved]: /skill/conceal-item-improved/
[perform-teleport-rite]: /skill/perform-teleport-rite/
